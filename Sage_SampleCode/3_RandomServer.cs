        [Description(@"This demonstration shows the random server's ability to maintain two
separate streams of random numbers that do not affect each other. The
demo uses two instances of class ""Activity"" as agents in the simulation.
The demo occurs in three parts. 

In the first part, we create a random server with one hyperseed, hs1, and 
then create two activities with different seeds, s1 and s2. The activities 
generate different outputs from each other. 

In the second part, we create a random server with a second hyperseed, hs2,
and then create two activities with the same seeds, s1 and s2, as before.
The activities generate different outputs from each other, and from their
outputs in the first part, demonstrating that a model can have fixed seeds
for elements within it, and achieve variability by altering the hyperseed only.

In the third part, we essentially replicate the second part, but this time,
we impose a change of behavior on the second instance of ""Activity."" The
behavior of the first instance of ""Activity"" remains identical to its
behavior in the second part of the demo, illustrating the decorrellated nature
of random channels. They can be used to hold one part of a simulation constant
and allow another to change."
