            [Description(@"This demo shows the modeling of a hierarchical process, in this case, that of
making brownies. There are tasks that can happen in parallel, and tasks that 
must happen serially. The top level task is ""Make Brownies"" and it has four
subtasks, ""Prepare Oven"", ""Prepare Pan"", ""Assemble Brownies"" and 
""Bake Brownies"" (technically, this must be serial to ""Assemble Brownies"",
but we manage this relationship by explicitly establishing a successor/follower
role between ""Assemble Brownies"" and ""Bake Brownies,"" and we can see that 
reflected in the output.

Under ""Prepare Pan"", there are two serial tasks, ""Acquire Pan"", and 
""Grease Pan"". Likewise, ""Assemble Brownies"" has serial subtasks, as does 
""Bake Brownies"". 

The task graph runs on Synchronous events, and each task signals its completion
when finished.

There are many more capabilities of the Task Graph construct, including 
hierarchical composite validity management (if there's no grease, you can't 
prepare the pan, and therefore you can't make the brownies), post-mortem
analysis (how long did we spend greasing the pan?), and simultaneous 
multiple instance execution (let's make three batches of brownies.)
