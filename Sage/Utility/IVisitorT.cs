    /// The purpose of the Visitor Pattern is to encapsulate
    /// an operation that you want to perform on the elements
    /// of a data structure. In this way, you can change the
    /// operation being performed on a structure without the
    /// need of changing the classes of the elements that you
    /// are operating on. Using a Visitor pattern allows you to
    /// decouple the classes for the data structure and the
    /// algorithms used upon them.
    /// <p></p>
    /// Each node in the data structure "accepts" a Visitor, which
    /// sends a message to the Visitor which includes the node's
    /// class. The visitor will then execute its algorithm for that
    /// element. This process is known as "Double Dispatching." The
    /// node makes a call to the Visitor, passing itself in, and the
    /// Visitor executes its algorithm on the node. In Double Dispatching,
    /// the call made depends upon the type of the Visitor and of the Host
    /// (data structure node), not just of one component.
